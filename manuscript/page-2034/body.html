<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>‘That noise?’</p><p>‘Ah Heaven, be quiet, cursed brigand!’ to a horse who shook his bells ‘What noise?’</p><p>‘Behind. Is it not another carriage at a gallop? There! what’s that?’</p><p>‘Miscreant with a Pig’s head, stand still!’ to another horse, who bit another, who frightened the other two, who plunged and backed. ‘There is nothing coming.’</p><p>‘Nothing.’</p><p>‘No, nothing but the day yonder.’</p><p>‘You are right, I think. I hear nothing now, indeed. Go on!’</p><p>The entangled equipage, half hidden in the reeking cloud from the horses, goes on slowly at first, for the driver, checked unnecessarily in his progress, sulkily takes out a pocket-knife, and puts a new lash to his whip. Then ‘Hallo, whoop! Hallo, hi!’ Away once more, savagely.</p></div> </div>
