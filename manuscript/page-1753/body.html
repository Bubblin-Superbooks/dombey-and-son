Hurrying out, and up towards her room, Florence met her immediately, coming down alone.</p><p>What was Florence’s affright and wonder when, at sight of her, with her tearful face, and outstretched arms, Edith recoiled and shrieked!</p><p>‘Don’t come near me!’ she cried. ‘Keep away! Let me go by!’</p><p>‘Mama!’ said Florence.</p><p>‘Don’t call me by that name! Don’t speak to me!
