The sea had ebbed and flowed, through a whole year. Through a whole year, the winds and clouds had come and gone; the ceaseless work of Time had been performed, in storm and sunshine. Through a whole year, the tides of human chance and change had set in their allotted courses. Through a whole year, the famous House of Dombey and Son had fought a fight for life, against cross accidents, doubtful rumours, unsuccessful ventures, unpropitious times, and most of all, against the infatuation of its head, who would not contract its enterprises by a hairâ€™s breadth, and would not listen to a word of warning that the ship he strained so hard against the storm, was weak, and could not bear it.</p></blockquote><p>The year was out, and the great House was down.</p></div> </div>
