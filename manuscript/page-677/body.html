I believe I have as much influence with your Papa as anybody has. Still, all I can say is, that he has said very little to me; and that I have only seen him once or twice for a minute at a time, and indeed have hardly seen him then, for his room has been dark. I have said to your Papa, “Paul!”—that is the exact expression I used—“Paul! why do you not take something stimulating?” Your Papa’s reply has always been, “Louisa, have the goodness to leave me. I want nothing. I am better by myself.” If I was to be put upon my oath to-morrow, Lucretia, before a magistrate,’ said Mrs Chick, ‘I have no doubt I could venture to swear to those identical words.’</p></div> </div>
