<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>‘All I could desire to say, and more, I have now said. All I mean goes beyond words, as I hope you understand and believe. The time has come, John—though most unfortunately and unhappily come—when I may help you without interfering with that redeeming struggle, which has lasted through so many years; since you were discharged from it today by no act of your own. It is late; I need say no more to-night. You will guard the treasure you have here, without advice or reminder from me.’</p><p>With these words he rose to go.</p><p>‘But go you first, John,’ he said goodhumouredly, ‘with a light, without saying what you want to say, whatever that maybe;’ John Carker’s heart was full, and he would have relieved it in speech, if he could; ‘and let me have a word with your sister. We have talked alone before, and in this room too; though it looks more natural with you here.’</p></div> </div>
