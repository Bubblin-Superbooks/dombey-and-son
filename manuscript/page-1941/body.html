Where did he go?’ she inquired, still holding him tight, and looking close into his face, with her sharp eyes.</p><p>‘Upon my soul, I don’t know, Misses Brown,’ answered Rob. ‘Upon my soul I don’t know what he did, nor where he went, nor anything about him I only know what he said to me as a caution to hold my tongue, when we parted; and I tell you this, Misses Brown, as a friend, that sooner than ever repeat a word of what we’re saying now, you had better take and shoot yourself, or shut yourself up in this house, and set it a-fire, for there’s nothing he wouldn’t do, to be revenged upon you. You don’t know him half as well as I do, Misses Brown. You’re never safe from him, I tell you.’</p></div> </div>
