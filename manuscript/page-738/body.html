This is kind of you, to be here so early to say good-bye to me. You knew how glad it would make me to shake hands with you, once, before going away. I cannot say how glad I am to have this opportunity. Pray come in.’</p><p>‘It is not likely that we may ever meet again, Walter,’ returned the other, gently resisting his invitation, ‘and I am glad of this opportunity too. I may venture to speak to you, and to take you by the hand, on the eve of separation. I shall not have to resist your frank approaches, Walter, any more.’</p></div> </div>
