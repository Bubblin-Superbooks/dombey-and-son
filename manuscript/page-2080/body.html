All these preparations that Susan and I are so busy with—I have been able to purchase very little for myself. You were poor before. But how much poorer I shall make you, Walter!’</p><p>‘And how much richer, Florence!’</p><p>Florence laughed, and shook her head.</p><p>‘Besides,’ said Walter, ‘long ago—before I went to sea—I had a little purse presented to me, dearest, which had money in it.’</p><p>‘Ah!’ returned Florence, laughing sorrowfully, ‘very little! very little, Walter! But, you must not think,’ and here she laid her light hand on his shoulder, and looked into his face, ‘that I regret to be this burden on you. No, dear love, I am glad of it. I am happy in it. I wouldn’t have it otherwise for all the world!’</p></div> </div>
