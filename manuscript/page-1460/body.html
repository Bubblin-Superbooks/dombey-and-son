I thought you’d have known that beforehand, perhaps,’ said Rob, rubbing his hands, and getting up. ‘If you could be so good as provide yourself soon, Captain, it would be a great convenience to me. You couldn’t provide yourself by to-morrow morning, I am afraid, Captain: could you, do you think?’</p><p>‘And you’re a going to desert your colours, are you, my lad?’ said the Captain, after a long examination of his face.</p><p>‘Oh, it’s very hard upon a cove, Captain,’ cried the tender Rob, injured and indignant in a moment, ‘that he can’t give lawful warning, without being frowned at in that way, and called a deserter.
