Bring it here, Withers. Dear me, my love; Mr Carker, too! That very sensible person!’</p><p>‘I am going out,’ repeated Edith, in so imperious a tone that Withers, going to the door, imperiously informed the servant who was waiting, ‘Mrs Dombey is going out. Get along with you,’ and shut it on him.</p><p>But the servant came back after a short absence, and whispered to Withers again, who once more, and not very willingly, presented himself before Mrs Dombey.</p><p>‘If you please, Ma’am, Mr Carker sends his respectful compliments, and begs you would spare him one minute, if you could—for business, Ma’am, if you please.’</p></div> </div>
